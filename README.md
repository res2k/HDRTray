HDRTray
=======
Windows Notification Area icon to show and change HDR status.
Useful if you quickly want to check the current setting, maybe because it might been changed automatically by some applications, or maybe just because you're forgetful.
Also allows quick toggling.

Usage
-----
After starting the program you can see a new notification area icon, displaying
either “SDR” or “HDR” depending on whether HDR is off or on.

HDR can be toggled on or off with a left-click on the icon.

Right-clicking opens the context menu offering an option to automatically start
the program when you log in to Windows.

Command line utility
--------------------
Since version 0.5, the `HDRCmd` command line utility is included. It can be used to toggle HDR on and off from scripts and check it's status.
